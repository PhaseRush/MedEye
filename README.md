# MedEye

#### A doctor's eye in your pocket.

Helps to identify different type of food in a market and their source based on barcodes. This gives the user information on where the food came from, news about the source of the food, and gives a rough estimate of the food miles on the product. Different ingredients and preservatives can be scanned and information about them can be shown in an easy to understand way.

#### Issue/Problem:
Every medication has benefits and risks with multitude of side effects, but there is a big gap between what customers know and what customers buy and take.
From 2000-2012, the number of yearly cases of serious medication errors increased from 3,065 to 6,855
About 400 died from such errors during the 13 year study
Close to 20 percent of adults report skipping medications because they are concerned about costs. Nonetheless, the U.S. may be spending close to $500 billion annually.


#### Introducing MedEye
A visual recognition app that helps users to understand the drug market better. The goal of this is to reduce information asymmetry by allowing users to instantly gather data on a specific type of drug. 

This is done through a camera based application on a smartphone or through the website interface. 

Information to be disseminated would be data on different alternatives; what the cost for the same drug is in different places; ingredients within the drug and research/ news on it, etc.

● Feasibility
It is doable and implementable. The actual business side of this app will depend on the relevant drug companies, but working with governments could streamline the process.
Benefits for companies is increase data flow - they get to receive and collect more data about what customers are concerned about and it them to understand their market better. 
Consumers benefit from increased transparency and better education on what they are putting in their bodies.

● Level of Difficulty
Challenges include receiving approval for the use of company drug information and available research into drugs. 
Companies may be reluctant to enter bertrand competition (competition by pricing).
